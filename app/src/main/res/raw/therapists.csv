Accessing Self energy can heal our more vulnerable & wounded parts. Holding space for you to turn your greatest wounds into your greatest gifts.|(581) 481-8452

Luella Jonk Consulting|Registered Psychotherapist, PhD, RP, IFMCP|I specialize in relationships. However, the most important relationship you can have is the relationship with Self. I feel self-trust is THE most important skill an individual can embody and master. If you trust yourself, you are unstoppable. To improve self-trust, we must learn to become uncomfortable, knowing that our choices may not always be correct and perfect, but we will learn from our choices. This allows growth and evolution. But to sit in anxiety and have the same recurring fears, doubts and worries without action is not a better solution. I help individuals go from good to great, with themselves and their relationships.|(431) 341-0384

Wai-Han Counselling|BA, MSc, MA|Wai-Han (慧娴) is my name. Wai: wisdom; Han: elegance. Being born & raised in a shame-based culture, from a young age, I was spoken over with things that were the opposite of this, that I do not measure up to my name. I experienced the power of words—that they can speak life or death, in my case evoking self-rejection. Through my journey toward healing, spoken words brought liberating life to me. Thus, I am passionate to speak life into people’s lives, to see individuals finding more internal freedom: feeling empowered and in control of their experiences: in the midst of struggling with depression, anxiety & challenging relationships.|(204) 400-0613

Lynette Sacco|Counsellor, MA, RPC|People are wired to desire closeness within relationships. However, early trauma and deep seated disappointment train our brains to use strategies to decrease painful emotional experiencing. When nobody was there to bring comfort or teach coping strategies, people either grow up to isolate or become over involved in the lives of others. Therapy explores not just the storyline but more importantly, the emotions and meanings beneath. In therapy people want to strike that balance of feeling cared for and understood by the therapist, while also being gently challenged to risk change and the discomfort that comes with growth.|(431) 400-4557

Christine Leger|Counsellor, MEd, CCC, FOT|"Trauma is at the root of many of our issues. Trauma is ""anything that overwhelms our ability to cope"" (Bessel van der Kolk). Ask yourself what you believe about traditional talk therapy for trauma. Do you worry that therapy will be an endless dredging of your emotional wounds with the faint hope that they will hurt less someday? Are you concerned that therapy means indefinite dependency on a therapist? Do you want to find the tools to cope with past and present issues?  If you answered YES to any or all of these questions and you are looking for an alternative to traditional talk therapy, Focusing might be right for you."|(431) 301-4352

Chris Haney|Registered Social Worker, MSW, TCTSY|One devasting effect of trauma is that it robs us of connection with others and ourselves. Instead, we isolate and distance ourselves out of survival. However, when we reach out to others, we are repairing that lost connection and begin to heal. Trauma usually happens in relation and so does recovery! If interested please book a free consultation here: chrishaney.janeapp.com, email or call. Thank you!|(204) 400-4081

Marcie Granger|Marriage & Family Therapist, MMFT, BEd, PBED|"Tired of behaving or reacting from unconscious patterns? Looking to understand your behaviours and where they come from?  Want to learn to have more compassion for yourself and others? Let's start with the inner-standing that everybody has fears, beliefs and rules for how they ""should"" be. Comprehending these narratives allows for compassionate curiosity around the origins and purposes of these stories that fuel our behaviours. Holistic exploration of these dialogues, can result in feeling and reacting differently and providing folks with new tools to move forward to overcome specific problems."|(204) 400-5113
Lynnea Thorkelson|Art Therapist, DVATI, R-CAT|My therapeutic offerings are rooted in the belief that every individual intuitively initiates a process of self-exploration and self-expression from birth.

Christine Holowick-Sparkes|Registered Social Worker, MMFT, BSW/RSW|We all experience difficult events in our lives. Some of these events happened a long time ago, and have influenced the way that we interact with ourselves and the world. Some of these events are more recent and throw us off the course we were on. We can become stuck in ways of being that are no longer helpful to us end up causing distress. I believe therapy can be a helpful way to process what has or is happening in our lives and encourage healthy adaptation and growth, so we can live our lives with more peace, happiness and connection.|(431) 531-5258

Ursula Ferreira|Registered Social Worker, BA, BSW, RSW|Most people think of trauma as rare events, but in reality, trauma is not rare and it does not exist in the external events themselves. Trauma is what happens inside of us, it lives within our nervous systems. A range of symptoms including depression, anxiety, anger, behavioural challenges, self-harming, relationship difficulties, low self-esteem, low motivation, and addictions have their roots in trauma. Trauma can take place in one-on-one relationships, in our communities, or be passed down through generations—its effect is pervasive.|(204) 784-7873

I facilitate improvements in communication with an approach that streamlines the process of therapy by working on the foundation of our issues, which helps alleviate the issues themselves."|(204) 784-0371

Lance Ludwig|Registered Social Worker, MSW, RSW|As humans, at  some point we are going to experience pain and suffering.  Fortunately, whether you struggle individually with anxiety and depression, or perhaps your relationship is in constant turmoil for any number of reasons, therapy can be healing and transformative. Service providers, such as nurses, teachers, 1st responders, child welfare and mental health workers are all highly susceptible to secondary trauma, compassion fatigue, and burnout.  Caring for people contending with serious illness, pain, trauma, and loss can affect one's own health, career, and relationships.|(204) 813-9076

I believe that counselling can offer a light in the darkness - a safe place to make sense of what we’re going through.

As a high performance athlete turned business operator across several industries, I have chased my passion for people into the world of high performance therapy, where my clients are often capable “doers” and “thinkers” who find themselves stuck, perhaps moving fast but not in directions that fill them up or facing challenges that feel out of their control.|

I also believe in our capacity to learn and grow, heal and change - a worthwhile process I am active to encourage. We all have experiences or relationships that are complex and add stress to our lives. We do not all choose to explore or understand our experiences and relationships and the impact they have, instead often living with a level of stress that is simply physically and emotionally unsustainable. Times of transition or change bring additional stress and can activate our deepest vulnerabilities.|(204) 900-8694
Judith Heppner|Registered Social Worker, MSW, RSW|"I am currently taking new clients. If you come to see me, you will probably laugh sometimes. That might surprise some people who think of therapy as something serious. I think of therapy as something that's very human. Sure, we will probably talk about upsetting things - that's why you're going, after all, because something is distressing and not working. But sometimes finding the humour in our situations is part of what needs to happen. Laughter, tears, ""Ah ha!"" moments - they're all there and important."|(204) 900-8634

Therapy is not one size fits all - it should be unique to you and your needs.

Kristy L. Taylor|Counsellor, MEd, CCC|I provide both short and long-term therapy services to anyone looking to process a vast array of psychological and personal issues. Often, we experience difficulties in our lives but are not entirely sure why. Consequently, we end up feeling alone and confused as we confront the same inner and outer conflicts time-and-time again. Understanding the reasons for our psychological struggles can be the first step in resolving these distresses. Grounded in Insight Therapy, which seeks to discover the roots of emotional suffering, I can help you recognize how events in your past are negatively influencing your current thoughts, emotions and behaviours.|(204) 232-9760
Abigail Wideman|Registered Social Worker, BSW, MSW, RSW, CPT|My intention in therapy is to keep it meaningful and simple; that each person walks away with something practical that can be used right away to ameliorate suffering for yourself and in your relationships.  Being a creative person, there is rarely a session without some incorporation of art, play, or experiential technique. I aim to be a facilitator of healing, facilitator meaning “to make easy”. What better way to make something easy then through fun and creativity? Prior to licensing as a therapist I worked in leadership. I have a passion for burnout prevention, compassion fatigue, and the working wounded.|(431) 831-3336

Crystal Barenz|Counsellor, BSc, FCGA, FCPA, MA, CCC|Right from when I was a little girl, I have enjoyed spending time listening to people’s stories. Most of my adult life I have spent as an accountant. However, I found that my true passion was always sitting with clients and not behind a computer.

You’re working hard to take care of everyone else yet still feeling intense guilt because it never seems like enough.  Even the simple things are beginning to feel more of an effort.

Sarah Hunter Murray|Marriage & Family Therapist, PhD, RMFT|"Not ""in the mood"" for sex? Missing that sexual spark? Wanting to feel more passionately and intimately connected to your partner? When sex is dissatisfying, painful, or feels like a ""chore,"" the problems don't tend to stay contained to the bedroom. We can internalize our concerns in the form of shame, stress, worry, and self-blame. We may criticize our partner and shut them out physically and emotionally. We might even doubt or question the quality, and even the future, of our romantic relationships. But when sex is mutually satisfying, enjoyable, and pleasurable, our romantic relationships are able to flourish and thrive."|(204) 400-3742

Kathryn Niebuhr|Registered Social Worker, MSW, RSW|Hello and welcome!  It might be difficult to put into words what you’re looking for in therapy- that is a valid starting place, and one I’m personally familiar with. Maybe you feel like you’re meeting external expectations and are ‘getting things done’, but masking an internal experience that’s more complex, leaving you feeling exhausted, unseen, and stuck. Perhaps you struggle with serving the needs of others first and use unhelpful habits to cope with emotions and get through day-to-day. Things don’t have to reach a boiling point before you seek support or prioritize your well-being.|(204) 808-1435

I'm passionate about supporting people to identify, challenge and replace negative core beliefs (i.e.: ""I'm not good enough"", ""I don't belong"", ""I can't trust people,"" ""my needs don't matter"") with adaptive, affirming beliefs. With compassion, skill, and a healthy dose of humour, I invite people to get curious about the parts of themselves that feel stuck, lost, reactive, or broken. By befriending these parts, they inevitably learn to soften the never-ending list of ""shoulds"", judgements, and fears."|(204) 400-3553
